<h1>Homely</h1>
<p>Application for guiding the first time home buyer through the process</p>
<p>In August 2019 I bought my first house!  I found that most real estate sites were set up for home buyers who already knew the process</p>
<p>It is a resource for first time home buyers that helps guide through the process.  Emphasis will be made on securing financing from local lenders.</p>
